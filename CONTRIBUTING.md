# Contributing to Awesome Claude Code

Welcome! We're excited that you want to contribute to Awesome Claude Code. This guide will walk you through our streamlined contribution process.

**Important:** We take security seriously. All submissions are carefully reviewed to ensure they don't expose users to data risks or malicious code. Advanced tools may take additional time to review.

## Code of Conduct

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](code-of-conduct.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. Follow the conventions of the repo and don't engage in self-promotion. Use descriptive language, not "marketing" style.

    A[📝 Fill out submission form] --> B[🤖 Automated validation]
    B --> C{Valid?}
    C -->|❌ No| D[Bot comments with issues]
    D --> E[Edit your submission]
    E --> B
    C -->|✅ Yes| F[Awaits maintainer review]
    F --> G{Decision}
    G -->|👍 Approved| H[Bot creates PR automatically]
    G -->|🔄 Changes requested| I[Maintainer requests changes]
    G -->|👎 Rejected| J[Issue closed with reason]
    I --> E
    H --> K[PR merged]
    K --> L[🎉 Resource goes live!]
    L --> M[You receive notification]
```

### What We Validate

When you submit a resource, our bot checks:

- ✅ All required fields are filled
- ✅ URLs are valid and accessible
- ✅ No duplicate resources exist
- ✅ License information (when available)
- ✅ Description length and quality

### If Changes Are Needed

Don't worry if validation fails! The bot will:

1. Post a clear comment explaining what needs to be fixed
2. Update the issue labels to reflect the status
3. Re-validate automatically when you edit your submission

Simply edit your issue to fix any problems - no need to create a new submission.

### Approval Process

Once validation passes:

1. A maintainer will review your submission for quality and relevance
2. They may:
   - ✅ **Approve** - Type `/approve` and the bot creates a PR
   - 🔄 **Request changes** - Type `/request-changes` with feedback
   - ❌ **Reject** - Type `/reject` with reason

### After Approval

The magic happens automatically:

1. Bot creates a fresh branch from latest main (no merge conflicts!)
2. Adds your resource to the CSV
3. Regenerates the README
4. Creates a pull request
5. Links everything back to your issue
6. Closes your submission issue

You'll be notified at every step, and if your resource is on GitHub, you'll receive a special notification issue in your repository! 🎉
